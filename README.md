# GDI_Sample
Disorganized code and data

- Excel file contains raw data generated from an experiment. It's in a 'wide' format - each column is a variable, each row is a participant in an experiment. 

- R file contains code to filter and format the data for a variety of preliminary analyses. 

- It's a mess, and I'm curious about exploring GitHub branches, best practices, more succinct functions, etc. to make this kind of task less horrible to write and share!
